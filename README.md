# BloomBox
BloomBox is a piano-like musical instrument, made using photo-sensor as the trigger for the sound output.

In the world of music, physical limitations and disabilities may prevent people from creating beautiful melodies using traditional instruments. For example, if the personâ€™s fingers are too short, it will hinder their ability to play many more challenging pieces on the traditional piano. Addressing this issue, a musical instrument was created resembling a piano but controlled using hands instead of relying on precise finger positions.
